      Steps I followed to make this website:
      <li>Linked the external style sheet to all the three html files</li>
      <li>Made the title of the website fancy. Had to use a seperate title named logo to do that</li>
      <li>Made navigation bar to keep things organised in different pages</li>
      <li>I used flex property to make two seperate columns and rows</li>
      <li>Edited the images online and added them to the website from royalty free websites</li>
      <li>Decreased the max width of the body tag in the CSS file from 2800px to 1280px as the screen scale was large</li>
      <li>Added flex property in the css file for main column to move the cake to the right</li>
      <li>Had to replace 40% with 70% flex basis in the main column</li>
      <li>Added another class in the section tag named middle col to keep things from getting intertwined</li>
      <li>In the about file, to move the images to the right, I used the style element within the img tag</li>
      <li>Added parallax effect before the footer</li>
      <li>Added a footer</li>
      <li>Linked all the html files</li>
  </ul>
