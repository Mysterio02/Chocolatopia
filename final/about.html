    <h1>History of Chocolate</h1>
    <p>The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from 
        chocolate date back to 450 BC.[1] The Mexica believed that cacao seeds were the 
        gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much value that 
        they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate 
        was served as a bitter liquid, mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to be 
        an aphrodisiac and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks are also known as 
        "Chilate" and are made by locals in the South of Mexico. After its arrival to Europe in 
        the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, 
        first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th century, 
        chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers during war.

        <p>

        The word "chocolate" comes from the Classical Nahuatl word XocolƒÅtl, and entered the English 
        language from the Spanish language.
